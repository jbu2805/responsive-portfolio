# Responsive portfolio-Jadranka Butorac

## Description

This week my task was to build my portfolio using placeholder images and technical skills that we have learnt over the last few weeks, with an emphasis on using CSS variables, grid box display and media queries. The aim is to use this application in the future to create a portfolio of work that will showcase my skills and talents as they progress over time.
